The two given sides can change. In other words, the same two sides are not always provided. Review the right triangle below.

image

The right triangle has sides AB, BC, and AC. Side AC is always the hypotenuse. Assume you are given the following input: AB is 3, BC is 4. Your application must identify the missing side as AC and the length as 5.

Input Format

The application should prompt for and read: (a) the name of the first side, (b) the length of the first side, (c) the name of the second side, (d) the length of the second side. The lengths will be integer values greater than one. The names will be two characters based on the figure above. Values will be AB, BC, or AC. Only valid data will be entered. Data will be entered from console. You do not need to edit the input data. Rerun your application to test each test case.

Constraints

Your Solution must accept 4 seperate inputs.

Output Format

The name of the missing side and the length of the missing side. Any decimal positions in the length of the missing side must be dropped not rounded.
