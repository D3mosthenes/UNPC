The goal in this problem is to sum all the digits in a number. However, each number must be “weighted” by its relative position in the number. For example, given the number 57 the weighted sum is 19. The weighted sum is calculated as: (5 * 1) + (7 * 2). Given the number 482178, the weighted sum is 113. The weighted sum is calculated as: (4 * 1) + (8 * 2) + (2 * 3) + (1 * 4) + (7 * 5) + (8 * 6).
